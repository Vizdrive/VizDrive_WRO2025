# WRO-Vizdrive-2025

![Vizdrive Logo)](./assets/model_photos/Vizdrive_logo.png)

Welcome to the project repository for the **Panamanian üáµüá¶ Team VizDrive** for the **World Robot Olympiad (WRO)** 2025!
Here you will find all the documentation, source code, images, and models related to our autonomous robot.

## Project Summary

VizDrive is an autonomous robot designed to navigate a closed-loop circuit, maintaining a stable trajectory with gyroscopic correction. It uses artificial vision, in conjunction with ultrasonic and color sensors, to detect walls and avoid obstacles.

We are participating in the **Future Engineers Category** to develop our skills and demonstrate the capabilities of young Panamanians in a competitive field like robotics.
