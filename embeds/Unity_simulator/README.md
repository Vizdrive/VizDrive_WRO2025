# Unity Simulator

During the robot's design and build phase, we developed a Unity simulator. 
This proved invaluable for defining the robot's core logic, optimizing sensor and actuator placement, and refining its overall functionality. 

Unity was an ideal choice due to its robust PhysX physics engine (simulating collisions, gravity, and friction), accurate sensor and camera emulation (providing the robot's perspective and sensory input), and C# scripting capabilities, which allowed us to prototype code similar to the real robot.

Testing before physical prototyping is essential for any robot build, and simulation with Unity is becoming more and more common for modern robot engineering.
